# Exemplo_Nardin

# Introduction

This project is an example of how to run a simulation of an Embedded Multiagent System (MAS). This simulation example is a robotic vehicle with 4 wheels, two distance sensors, and a battery, using the Webots simulator. 

The project structure is composed of 3 main parts:

* _controllers_: The robot's controller for the Webots simulator
* _MAS_ : Starting MAS project with ChonIDE
* _worlds_ : The scenario for the simulator

# Prerequisites 

To run this example, you have to be running one of the following Linux distributions :

* Ubuntu ( 22.04 or 24.04 )
* Mint
* Debian 12

1. Install the Webots simulator from (https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots)

2. Install the following packages using apt:

`sudo apt install git make gcc`

3. Install the following packages from ChonOS:

 - Add ChonOS repositories following the instructions in https://packages.chon.group/
 - Install the following packages using apt: 

`sudo apt install chonide chonos-serial-port-emulator`

# Compilation

To compile this example from the Command Line Interface (CLI):

1. Open a CLI terminal and create/go to the folder you wish to download the project to.

For exemple, if you wish to install it in the home folder of the current logged user:

`cd ~/` 

2. Download the project with git.

`git clone https://github.com/bptfreitas/Exemplo_Nardin`

2. Enter the folder and run _make_

`cd Exemplo_Nardin`
`make all`

This will download and compile the library [_JavinoInC_](https://github.com/chon-group/JavinoInC.git)

This process also assumes that the default installation folder of Webots resides in the folder _/usr/local/webots_ . If that is not the case, you should supply the correct folder in make's invocation:

`make WEBOTS_HOME=/path/to/correct/folder all`

# Execution

1. To start the scenario from the CLI, you have to be in the project folder and run:

`webots --mode=pause worlds/world01.wbt`

This will start the simulator paused so you can open the MAS project first.

To run it detached from the CLI instead:

`nohup webots --mode=pause worlds/world01.wbt &`

The simulator should open with the following screen:

2. Start the ChonIDE Embedded MAS IDE

For example, if you are running the Ubuntu 22.04, press the SUPER key and enter on the search "_ChonIDE_".

3. After logging in, select "Import Project"

4. Navigate to the folder of the downloaded project and, in the MAS folder, select the corresponding MAS project for ChonIDE.

5. Done! You can start programming the MAS for the loaded scenario :)
